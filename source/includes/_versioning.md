# Versioning

SpotSkim API versions are specified as part of the URLs. It is *not* part of header strings 

As an example, the currently supported versions of APIs are 2.1 and 2.5. This is subject to change as new versions are introduced

Generally we try to keep the versions of the API consistent with the versions of the server code. When developing new code, developers are encouraged to always use the latest version of the API available at that time.

APIs are generally expected to be backward compatible. If there are fixes announced (due to an emergency security issue as an example), the documentation reflects the change
